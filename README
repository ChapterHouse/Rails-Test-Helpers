RailsTestHelpers  (v1.0.0)
================

When you write rails tests, you will find that you are writing many of the same types of tests over and over again.
Unlike writing new types of tests that are very specific to a model or controller, doing standard tests becomes tedious
and lets face it, no longer fun. When there is no fun, even the most ardent developer will be tempted to skip on tests.
From there, all roads lead to madness, or at the very least a lot of pain.

The Rails Test Helpers attempt to remove the tedium by making the standard tests as easy and quick as possible to write
as well as read. They do not create a new testing infrastructure or paradigm. Rather they facilitate the built in rails
testing process. They try to cover the most common tests and variations. Additionally they expose their inner workings
to allow you to leverage common tasks into your own specialized tests.

The simplicity of the test helpers is probably most apparent when seen in action. So, without further ado, here is an
example of a standard unit and functional test when the helpers are applied. Compare these to your usual tests and
decide on the speed and maintainability for yourself.

Unit Test Example
================

  class ItemTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  
    DefaultValues =  {
      :name => "Some Name",
      :color => "Blue",
      :placement => "Ceiling", 
      :quantity => 7,
      :email => "foo@bar.baz"
    }
  
    test_create
    test_format_of :email
    test_inclusion_of :placement
    test_length_of :name => 3..100
    test_long :placement => 32
    test_numericality_of :quantity
    test_presence_of :name, :color, :placement, :quantity, :email
    test_short :color => 3
    test_uniqueness_of :email
    test_update :name => "Sum Name"
  
  end 


Functional Test Example
================

  class ItemsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  
    DefaultValues =  {
      :name => "Some Name",
      :color => "Blue",
      :placement => "Ceiling", 
      :quantity => 7,
      :email => "foo@bar.baz"
    }
  
    use_defaults
  
    test_index
    test_new
    test_create
    test_show
    test_edit
    test_update :name => 'Sum Name'
    test_destroy
    test_shouldnt_create :name => nil
    test_shouldnt_update :name => nil
  
  end



Requirements
================

Rails Test Helpers currently depends on Rails 2.0 or later and the Restful Authentication Plugin
